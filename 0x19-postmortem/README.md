## Issue Summary:

On 14th August 2024, from 2:30 PM to 3:15 PM (GMT+1), we experienced a significant database connection failure that impacted our web application. The outage lasted for 45 minutes, during which 85% of our users were unable to access the platform. The remaining 15% faced intermittent slowdowns. The root cause was an incorrect database password configuration during a MySQL update that led to authentication failures.

## Timeline (GMT+1):

| Time   | Event                                                                                     |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2:30 PM | Monitoring alerts triggered due to increased error rates in database connections.        |
| 2:32 PM | On-call engineer acknowledged the alert.                                                 |
| 2:35 PM | Initial investigation began, focusing on the application layer for potential code issues.|
| 2:45 PM | Redirected investigation to database connectivity, suspecting network issues.            |
| 2:50 PM | Issue escalated to the DevOps team after identifying MySQL authentication errors.        |
| 3:00 PM | Root cause identified as an incorrect password during the MySQL user creation process.   |
| 3:05 PM | Password was reset and the MySQL user reconfigured.                                      |
| 3:10 PM | Database connections restored and the application returned to normal operation.          |
| 3:15 PM | Monitoring confirmed that all services were fully operational.                           |

## Root Cause and Resolution:

The incident was caused by an incorrect password configuration during the setup of a new MySQL user. When the database was updated earlier that day, the password entered was mistyped, but the update proceeded without error. As a result, when the application attempted to connect to the database, it encountered repeated authentication failures, leading to the outage. The issue was resolved by resetting the password and correctly reconfiguring the MySQL user.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following actions will be taken:

Improvement in Deployment Process: All database changes will be tested in a staging environment before being applied to production. This includes verifying database credentials.
Enhanced Monitoring: Additional monitoring will be implemented to detect authentication issues at the database level more quickly.
Automation: Automate the database user creation process to reduce the risk of human error when entering credentials.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Implement a staging environment for all database updates.
Add monitoring alerts specifically for database authentication errors.
Create a script for automated database user creation and password management.
Conduct training sessions on best practices for database management and deployment.
